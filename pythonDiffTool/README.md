# This is going to be an attempt at implementing the levenshtein algorithm
  first. After that I will use the implemention to create a diff tool like the
  one unix has, but with the added benefit of being able to automatically change
  one file into the other one, i.e fix the diff. 
  
  I have some grand idea of trying to see if I can replicate git somehow just so
  I understand how that works better, these things will not be the most optimal
  implementaiton of anything its mostly to explore some new stuff and learn new
  things. 
  
  The final goal of this project is that once I have understood the subject
  matter well enough to implement it as described above, I will the re-write the
  entire thing in Rust to practice rust but also to compare the performance.
